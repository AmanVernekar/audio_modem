Alright, let's go wild. Have you ever thought about how bizarre the concept of pineapple on pizza is? It's like someone looked at a pizza and thought, "You know what this needs? A tropical fruit that completely defies the savory nature of everything else on here." And somehow, it works for some people! And speaking of weird combinations, why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways? Language is such a weird beast. If you think about it too long, it starts to feel like we’re just making sounds and hoping other people understand what we mean. Ever considered how weird it is that we’re all just a bunch of evolved apes typing on tiny screens to communicate? Sometimes I wonder what ancient humans would think if they saw us now, staring at these glowing rectangles all day. Oh, and here’s a fun one: Did you know that there are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe? Makes you wonder how anyone can claim to be good at it when there’s just so much that could happen. Feel like taking this randomness further?
